# Somatic Justice & Community Joy Toolkit

## Purpose & Vision

This toolkit is a living resource for trauma therapists, community organizers, healing practitioners, and anyone committed to integrating social justice frameworks with body‑based healing. Grounded in the wisdom of marginalized communities—particularly BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, disabled, and trauma‑surviving folks—it offers practices that center **somatic justice**, **communal joy**, and **accessible, liberatory movement**.

We believe that healing from systemic oppression must be rooted in the body and nourished by community. Singing, dancing, call‑and‑response, and other collective rituals are not just “self‑care” but acts of resistance and reclamation. This toolkit is an invitation to build spaces where trauma can be processed without isolation, and where joy can be cultivated as a collective resource.

## Core Principles

*   **Somatic Justice:** Recognizing that trauma lives in the body and that liberation requires bodily autonomy, safety, and expression.
*   **Community‑Centered Healing:** Moving beyond individualistic models to practices that strengthen connection, mutual aid, and collective resilience.
*   **Accessibility by Design:** Every module includes adaptations for different mobility levels, sensory needs, and energy capacities.
*   **Joy as a Practice:** Actively creating moments of pleasure, play, and celebration as essential counter‑weights to oppression and trauma.
*   **Wisdom of the Margins:** Honoring the lineages of Black, Indigenous, queer, disabled, and other marginalized communities that have long used embodied practices for survival and transformation.

## How to Use This Toolkit

*   **For Therapists & Facilitators:** Integrate these modules into individual or group sessions. Use them to help clients reconnect with their bodies, build community resources, and find moments of joy amid trauma work.
*   **For Community Organizers:** Incorporate grounding practices before meetings, use movement breaks to sustain energy, and create communal song as a way to build solidarity.
*   **For Personal Practice:** Explore the modules at your own pace. Adapt them to your needs, and remember that healing is not a linear path—allow yourself to move between different practices as your body and spirit ask.

## Current Modules

*   [Liberatory Movement for All Bodies](./modules/liberatory-movement.md) – Seated and standing movement practices that honor diverse bodies and mobilities as sites of resistance and joy.

*(More modules will be added as the toolkit grows.)*
