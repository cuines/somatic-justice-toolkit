# Contributing to the Somatic Justice & Community Joy Toolkit

We are thrilled that you want to contribute to this living resource. Your lived experience, professional knowledge, and creative ideas are exactly what will make this toolkit more robust, inclusive, and useful.

## How to Contribute

### 1. **Start with an Issue**
Before you write a new module or make substantial changes, please open an **Issue** describing what you’d like to add or improve. This lets us discuss the idea, ensure it aligns with the toolkit’s principles, and avoid duplicate work.

### 2. **Fork the Repository**
If you’re ready to work on a module or edit an existing file, fork this repository to your own GitHub account. Clone it locally and create a new branch for your changes.

### 3. **Create a Branch**
Use a descriptive branch name, such as:
- `feature/grounding-call-response`
- `fix/typo-readme`
- `docs/add-license-note`

### 4. **Write with Our Principles in Mind**
- **Accessibility:** Always include adaptations for different bodies, mobility levels, sensory needs, and energy capacities.
- **Inclusive Language:** Use person‑first, affirming, and non‑pathologizing language. Honor the diverse identities of people who will use these resources.
- **Citation & Attribution:** If you are drawing from a specific cultural practice, lineage, or author, provide clear attribution and context.
- **Trauma‑Informed:** Frame instructions in a way that invites choice, honors boundaries, and avoids triggering language.

### 5. **Commit and Push**
Commit your changes with clear, concise commit messages. Push your branch to your fork.

### 6. **Open a Pull Request**
Open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the `main` branch of this repository. In the PR description:
- Explain what the PR adds or changes.
- Reference the related issue by typing `Closes #X` (where X is the issue number).
- Note any adaptations or accessibility considerations you’ve included.

### 7. **Review Process**
At least one maintainer will review your PR. We may ask for clarifications, suggest small edits, or discuss how the contribution fits within the broader toolkit. Once the review is approved, we’ll merge your changes.

## What You Can Contribute

### **New Modules**
Modules are the heart of the toolkit. Each module should:
- Be a standalone Markdown file placed in the `modules/` directory.
- Have a clear, descriptive title.
- Include a brief introduction explaining the practice’s purpose and grounding.
- Provide step‑by‑step instructions (with adaptations where relevant).
- End with a short reflection or invitation for integration.

Examples of module topics:
- Grounding through breath and sound
- Call‑and‑response rituals for group cohesion
- Movement practices for different mobility levels
- Song‑sharing and communal singing
- Visualizations for somatic safety

### **Edits to Existing Content**
- Fix typos, improve clarity, or update language to be more inclusive.
- Add missing adaptations or accessibility notes.
- Expand a module with additional variations or cultural context.

### **Documentation**
- Improve this contributing guide.
- Add a code‑of‑conduct or community‑agreement document.
- Translate modules into other languages (please open an issue first to coordinate).
